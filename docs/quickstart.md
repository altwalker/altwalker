# Quickstart

In this quickstart you will learn how to create your tests project [from scratch](#start-from-scratch) or [from an existing model](#start-from-an-existing-model) and run your tests with altwalker. To learn how to install altwalker follow our [installation guide](./installation.md)

## Start from scratch

`altwalker init tests`

The init command creates tests directory and initializez a git repository. The tests directory contains a model file `tets/models/default.json` and tests package `tests/tests`.


`altwalker online tests/tests -m tests/models/default.json "random(edge_coverage(100) && vertex_coverage(100))"`

The online command runs your tests inside `tests` package based on the path generated by graphwalker from `default.json` model.

## Start from an existing model

Download [login-model.json](./_static/login-model.json)

`altwalker generate -m login-model.json login-tests`

The generate command creates a `login-tests/tests` python package containing a definition for all methods in your `login-model.json`

`altwalker online login-tests/tests -m login-model.json "random(edge_coverage(100) && vertex_coverage(100))"`


## Next steps

Depending on how new you are to Altwalker you can checkout a  [demo](./demo.md), dig deeper into [altwalker cli](./cli.rst) or understand how to [design your tests](./modeling.md).
