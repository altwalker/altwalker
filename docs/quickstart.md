# Quickstart

In this quickstart you will learn how to create your tests project [from scratch](#start-from-scratch) or [from an existing model](#start-from-an-existing-model) and run your tests with altwalker. To learn how to install altwalker follow our [installation guide](./installation.md)

## Start from scratch

```
$ altwalker init test-project
```

The init command creates tests directory and initializez a git repository. The tests directory contains a model file `test-project/models/default.json` and tests package `test-poject/tests`.


```
$ cd test-project
$ altwalker online tests -m models/default.json "random(edge_coverage(100) && vertex_coverage(100))"
```

The online command runs your tests inside `tests` package based on the path generated by graphwalker from `default.json` model.

## Start from an existing model

```
$ altwalker generate -m <your-model-path.json> <your-tests-package-name>
```

The generate command creates a  python tests package containing a definition for all methods in your model
After you generate the tests package, run your tests.

```
$ altwalker online <your-tests-package-name>/tests -m <your-model-path.json> "random(edge_coverage(100) && vertex_coverage(100))"
```

## Next steps

Depending on how new you are to Altwalker you can checkout a  [demo](./demo.md), dig deeper into [altwalker cli](./cli.rst) or understand how to [design your tests](./modeling.md).
