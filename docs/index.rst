Welcome to AltWalker's documentation!
=====================================

AltWalker is an open source, Model-based testing framework for automating your test
execution. You design your tests as a directional graph and altwalker executes them.
It relies on `Graphwalker <http://graphwalker.github.io/>`_ to generate paths through
your tests graph.

Welcome to AltWalker's documentation. Get started with :doc:`installation` and
then get an quick overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
detailed :doc:`demo` that shows how to create a small test project for a
mock e-commerce website. The rest of the documentation describes how to
use each feature of AltWalker in more details.
