=====================================
Welcome to AltWalker's documentation!
=====================================

AltWalker is an open source, Model-Based Testing framework for automating your test
execution. You design your tests as a directed graph and AltWalker executes
them. It relies on `GraphWalker <http://graphwalker.github.io/>`_ to generate
paths through your tests graph.

Get started with :doc:`installation` and then get a quick overview with
the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a list of :doc:`how-tos` and a list
of runnable :doc:`examples`. The rest of the documentation describes
how to use each feature of AltWalker in more details.
