=====================================
Welcome to AltWalker's documentation!
=====================================

AltWalker is an open source Model-Based Testing framework that supports running
tests written in python3 and .NET/C#. You design your tests as a directed graph
and AltWalker generates test cases from your graph (using `GraphWalker <http://graphwalker.github.io/>`_)
and executes them.

Get started with :doc:`installation` and then get a quick overview with
the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a list of :doc:`how-tos` and a list
of runnable :doc:`examples`. The rest of the documentation describes
how to use each feature of AltWalker in more details.
