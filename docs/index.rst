=====================================
Welcome to AltWalker's documentation!
=====================================

AltWalker is an open source, Model-based testing framework for automating your test
execution. You design your tests as a directional graph and AltWalker executes
them. It relies on `GraphWalker <http://graphwalker.github.io/>`_ to generate
paths through your tests graph.

Welcome to AltWalker's documentation. Get started with :doc:`installation` and
then get an quick overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
list of :doc:`how-tos` and a list of runnable :doc:`examples`. The rest
of the documentation describes how to use each feature of AltWalker in
more details.
